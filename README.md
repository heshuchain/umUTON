# um UTON Blockchain

#mainly forkd from evmosd

The UTON blockchain is a public blockchain built on top of the Tendermint module. A Byzantine fault-tolerant PoS consensus mechanism is adopted to support high-availability, high-concurrency and high-throughput transactions. At the same time, it is compatible with the Ethereum protocol and the EVM virtual machine, and has good scalability.
